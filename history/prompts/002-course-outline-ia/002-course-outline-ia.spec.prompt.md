# Course Outline IA Spec Creation

## PROMPT_TEXT

Convert hackathon course outline into a Docusaurus information architecture: overview, learning outcomes, weekly breakdown, assessments, hardware requirements, and module structure pages. Acceptance: sidebar matches structure; all required "meta" pages exist and link correctly.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created a comprehensive specification for converting a hackathon course outline into a Docusaurus information architecture. The specification includes:

- Overview of transforming course content into Docusaurus format
- Three primary user scenarios for students, instructors, and curriculum designers
- Five functional requirements covering course structure, navigation, meta pages, content organization, and accessibility
- Five measurable success criteria focusing on structural integrity, navigation accuracy, content completeness, link integrity, and user experience
- Key entities defined including Course Module, Learning Outcome, Weekly Unit, Assessment, Hardware Requirement, and Meta Page
- Proper quality assurance with all checklist items validated

The specification is technology-agnostic, focuses on user value, and all requirements are testable and measurable. Ready for the planning phase.

## OUTCOME

Complete specification created for Docusaurus information architecture conversion of hackathon course outline. All requirements met and specification is ready for planning phase.
