# Plan Module 2 content production for Docusaurus: define the full Module 2 table of contents with file paths + doc IDs for each lesson/lab, define the lab format for runnable steps (setup → commands → expected output → verification → troubleshooting), define asset strategy for simulation files (where to place world files, URDF/SDF snippets, launch examples), define cross-linking to Module 1 prerequisites and Module 3 next steps, and define a content QA plan for consistency and technical sanity. Acceptance: the plan is actionable and results in a complete Module 2 with consistent formatting, reproducible labs, coherent progression, and stable internal links.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created a comprehensive implementation plan for Module 2 (Gazebo/Simulation) content production with:

- Complete table of contents with file paths for all lessons and exercises
- Defined lab format for runnable steps (setup → commands → expected output → verification → troubleshooting)
- Asset strategy for simulation files (worlds, models, launch files in static/assets/module-2/)
- Cross-linking strategy between modules
- Content QA plan for consistency and technical verification
- Research, data model, and quickstart documentation
- Technical context and constitutional compliance verification

The plan is actionable and ready for the task generation phase.
