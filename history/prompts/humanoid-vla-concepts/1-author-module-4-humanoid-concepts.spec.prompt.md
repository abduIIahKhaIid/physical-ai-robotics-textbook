# Prompt History Record: author-module-4-humanoid-concepts

## Original Prompt

```
Author Module 4: humanoid kinematics/locomotion/manipulation basics + VLA concepts + conversational robotics chapter. Acceptance: complete module; capstone-style wrap-up; clear learning outcomes.
```

## Response Summary

Created comprehensive specification for Module 4 covering:
- Humanoid kinematics fundamentals (forward/inverse kinematics, joint configurations)
- Locomotion concepts (bipedal walking, gait patterns, balance control)
- Manipulation basics (grasping, object interaction, dexterous manipulation)
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their role in humanoid robotics
- Conversational robotics (dialogue systems, social interaction)
- Capstone-style wrap-up integrating all concepts
- Clear learning outcomes and assessment tools

The specification includes three prioritized user stories:
1. Complete Module Learning Journey (P1)
2. Capstone-Style Wrap-Up Experience (P2)
3. Clear Learning Outcomes Achievement (P3)

Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) cover all major concepts with emphasis on educational delivery. Success criteria include measurable outcomes like 85% completion rates and 80% assessment scores.

Two initial clarification markers were resolved with reasonable defaults regarding VLA concept depth and safety considerations.
