# Research Findings: Module 4 Content Production

## Decision: Module 4 Table of Contents and Structure
**Rationale**: Based on the user requirements, Module 4 needs to follow a coherent progression from humanoid fundamentals to advanced VLA and conversational robotics concepts, culminating in a capstone experience.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Parallel topic structure vs. sequential progression
- Individual chapters vs. integrated module approach

## Decision: Hardware Tier Support Strategy
**Rationale**: Different students have varying access to hardware, so the content must be accessible to those with minimal hardware (simulator only) while still providing value to those with advanced humanoid platforms.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simulation-only approach vs. hardware-focused content
- Progressive complexity levels vs. single-tier approach

## Decision: Lab/Exercise Structure
**Rationale**: Hands-on activities must include concept checks, small coding workflows, and simulation-based experiments that work across different hardware tiers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complex ROS workflows vs. simplified exercises
- Hardware-dependent vs. simulation-based activities

## Decision: Cross-linking Strategy
**Rationale**: Content must reference prerequisites from hardware/setup pages and Module 3 perception/navigation pipelines while maintaining forward/backward references for coherent learning flow.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Embedded content vs. external linking
- Deep integration vs. modular independence

## Decision: Content QA Plan
**Rationale**: To avoid hand-wavy explanations, the content will include explicit definitions, diagram descriptions, verification steps, and troubleshooting guides.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Conceptual overview vs. detailed explanations
- Generic troubleshooting vs. specific verification steps
