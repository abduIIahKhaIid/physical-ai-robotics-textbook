**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Author Module 4: humanoid kinematics/locomotion/manipulation basics + VLA concepts + conversational robotics chapter. Acceptance: complete module; capstone-style wrap-up; clear learning outcomes."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Module Learning Journey (Priority: P1)

Student accesses Module 4 to learn fundamental concepts of humanoid robotics, including kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, and conversational robotics. The student should be able to understand core principles and apply them in practical scenarios through exercises and examples.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational learning experience that delivers the entire module's value proposition to students studying physical AI and humanoid robotics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a student complete the entire module and demonstrate understanding through quizzes, exercises, and practical applications of the concepts covered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student begins Module 4, **When** they progress through all lessons sequentially, **Then** they gain comprehensive understanding of humanoid kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, VLA concepts, and conversational robotics.

2. **Given** student has completed prerequisite modules, **When** they engage with hands-on exercises in Module 4, **Then** they can implement basic humanoid movement and interaction algorithms.

### User Story 2 - Capstone-Style Wrap-Up Experience (Priority: P2)

Student completes the capstone-style wrap-up section that integrates all concepts learned in the module, demonstrating synthesis of humanoid kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, VLA models, and conversational robotics.

**Why this priority**: The capstone provides essential integration and application of all concepts learned, ensuring students can synthesize multiple concepts into a cohesive understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by evaluating student performance on the capstone project and their ability to connect different concepts from the module.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has completed individual lessons in Module 4, **When** they work on the capstone project, **Then** they demonstrate mastery by connecting kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, VLA, and conversational robotics concepts.

### User Story 3 - Clear Learning Outcomes Achievement (Priority: P3)

Student can identify and articulate the specific learning outcomes of Module 4, understanding what they should be able to do after completing the module.

**Why this priority**: Clear learning outcomes provide direction and measurable goals for students, enabling them to assess their progress and mastery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having students articulate the module's learning outcomes and demonstrate achievement of those outcomes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student reviews Module 4 introduction, **When** they examine the stated learning outcomes, **Then** they understand what skills and knowledge they will acquire.
