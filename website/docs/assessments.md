# Assessments: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach emphasizes practical application of concepts learned in the course. Students will engage in a variety of assessment methods designed to evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

## Assessment Types

### Module Assessments (70% of Grade)
Each module includes specific assessments to evaluate mastery of the concepts:

#### Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI (25% total)
- **Quiz**: 10% - Fundamental concepts of Physical AI
- **Practical Exercise**: 15% - Simulation and basic implementation tasks

#### Module 2: Robot Kinematics and Dynamics (15% total)
- **Simulation Project**: 15% - Kinematic and dynamic modeling challenges

#### Module 3: Control Systems and Locomotion (20% total)
- **Control System Design Project**: 20% - Implementation of feedback control systems

#### Module 4: Advanced AI for Humanoid Systems (25% total)
- **Capstone Project**: 25% - Complete humanoid system integration and evaluation

### Participation and Engagement (15% of Grade)
- **Discussion Forum Participation**: 7% - Active engagement in peer discussions
- **Peer Reviews**: 5% - Constructive feedback on fellow students' work
- **Live Session Participation**: 3% - Engagement in virtual classrooms

### Continuous Assessment (15% of Grade)
- **Weekly Coding Challenges**: 8% - Regular programming exercises
- **Reflection Journals**: 4% - Personal learning reflections
- **Portfolio Development**: 3% - Professional development artifacts

## Grading Scale

- **A**: 90-100% - Excellent mastery of concepts and exceptional application
- **B**: 80-89% - Good understanding with solid application skills
- **C**: 70-79% - Adequate grasp of fundamentals with satisfactory application
- **D**: 60-69% - Basic understanding with limited application ability
- **F**: Below 60% - Insufficient understanding and application

## Assessment Criteria

### Excellent (A Level)

- Applies knowledge creatively to novel problems
- Shows exceptional technical implementation skills
- Communicates ideas clearly and professionally
- Exceeds assignment requirements meaningfully

### Good (B Level)
- Shows strong understanding of core concepts
- Applies knowledge effectively to familiar problems
- Demonstrates solid technical implementation skills
- Communicates ideas clearly
- Meets assignment requirements with some additional insights

### Adequate (C Level)
- Understands fundamental concepts
- Applies knowledge to standard problems
- Shows basic technical implementation skills
- Communicates ideas adequately
- Meets minimum assignment requirements

### Limited (D/F Level)
- Shows gaps in conceptual understanding
- Struggles with basic applications
- Demonstrates weak technical skills
- Communication needs improvement
- Does not meet assignment requirements

## Assessment Schedule

## Submission Guidelines

### Format Requirements
- All code submissions must include proper documentation
- Reports should follow the provided template
- Simulations must include detailed analysis
- Citations should follow the specified format

### Late Work Policy
- Late submissions will incur a 5% penalty per day
- Extensions granted only for documented emergencies
- Prior notification required for any accommodation request

## Feedback and Revision

### Feedback Timeline
- Quizzes: Within 3 days of submission
- Projects: Within 1 week of submission
- Capstone work: Within 2 weeks of submission

### Revision Opportunities
- Students may revise major projects once after receiving feedback
- Resubmission must occur within 1 week of feedback
- Final grade will be the average of original and revised work

## Academic Integrity

All assessments must represent your own original work. Collaboration is encouraged for learning purposes, but individual submissions must reflect your own understanding and implementation. Proper attribution is required for any external sources or collaborative efforts.

## Resources and Support

### Assessment Preparation
- Practice exercises available in each module
- Sample submissions from previous cohorts
- Office hours for assessment-related questions
- Peer study groups facilitated through discussion forums

### Support Services
- Technical support for simulation platforms
- Writing center for report preparation
- Math tutoring for computational aspects
- Accessibility services for accommodations
