# Course Overview: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to our comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This course explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on the development of intelligent machines that can interact with the physical world in human-like ways.

## Course Structure

This course is organized into four comprehensive modules:

- [Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI](./module-1/) - Understanding the basics of AI in physical systems
- [Module 2: Robot Kinematics and Dynamics](./module-2/) - Mechanical principles underlying robotic movement
- [Module 3: Control Systems and Locomotion](./module-3/) - How robots move and maintain balance
- [Module 4: Advanced AI for Humanoid Systems](./module-4/) - Cutting-edge AI techniques for humanoid robots

## Learning Path

We recommend following the course in sequence:

[Start Here](./learning-objectives) → [Learning Objectives](./learning-objectives) → [Weekly Breakdown](./syllabus) → [Assessments](./assessments) → [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements) → [Modules](./module-1/)
