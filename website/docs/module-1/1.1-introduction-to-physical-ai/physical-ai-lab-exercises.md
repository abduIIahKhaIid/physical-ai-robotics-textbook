# Week 1 Exercises: Foundations of Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Apply Physical AI concepts to practical scenarios
- Distinguish between digital and physical AI approaches
- Analyze the implications of embodiment for AI system design
- Develop critical thinking about the differences between digital and physical AI systems

## Exercise 1: Conceptual Analysis

### Task
Compare and contrast the challenges of developing a digital chess AI versus a physical robot that plays chess with physical pieces.

### Setup
- Digital chess AI: Runs on a computer, processes symbolic representations of the game board
- Physical chess robot: Must physically manipulate pieces, perceive the board state, and operate in the real world

### Instructions
1. Identify at least 5 challenges unique to the physical chess robot
2. Identify at least 3 advantages the digital system has over the physical one
3. Consider the following aspects:
   - Time constraints
   - Sensor accuracy
   - Actuator precision
   - Environmental factors
   - Safety considerations

### Expected Output
A 300-500 word analysis comparing the two approaches, highlighting the fundamental differences in challenges and capabilities.

### Verification
- Your analysis should clearly distinguish between digital and physical constraints
- You should identify at least 5 physical challenges and 3 digital advantages
- Your writing should demonstrate understanding of real-time operation and physical constraints

## Exercise 2: Design Thinking

### Task
Consider a household task (e.g., making coffee). Identify the physical constraints and real-time requirements that would make this challenging for a Physical AI system.

### Setup
- Choose one household task: making coffee, setting the table, folding laundry, or another task you're familiar with
- Analyze the task from the perspective of a Physical AI system (e.g., a robot)

### Instructions
1. Break down your chosen task into 5-7 sequential steps
2. For each step, identify the physical constraints involved
3. Identify the real-time requirements for each step
4. Consider sensor and actuator limitations
5. Analyze how environmental variations might affect the task

### Expected Output
A detailed analysis document with:
- Task breakdown with steps
- Physical constraints for each step
- Real-time requirements for each step
- Discussion of sensor/actuator limitations
- Analysis of environmental variations

### Verification
- Each step should have clear physical constraints identified
- Real-time requirements should be specific and realistic
- You should demonstrate understanding of the challenges of physical interaction
- Your analysis should reflect the complexity of real-world tasks

- Find a biological example where the body shape or physical properties contribute to intelligent behavior

### Instructions
1. Research and select one example of morphological computation in biology
2. Describe the biological system and how it exhibits morphological computation
3. Explain the advantage this provides to the organism
4. Propose how this principle could be applied to robotics

## Exercise 4: Embodiment Analysis

### Task
Analyze how the embodiment of an AI system affects its intelligence and capabilities.

### Setup

- For example: the same navigation algorithm on a wheeled robot vs. a legged robot

### Instructions
1. Choose a specific AI capability (navigation, manipulation, perception, etc.)
2. Design two different embodiments for this capability
3. Analyze how each embodiment would affect the AI's approach to the task
4. Consider advantages and disadvantages of each approach
5. Reflect on how the embodiment shapes the "intelligence" of the system

### Expected Output
A comparative analysis (400-600 words) including:
- Description of the AI capability chosen
- Design of two different embodiments
- Comparative analysis of how embodiment affects approach

- Design a basic Physical AI system for this application

### Instructions
1. Define the specific application and its requirements
2. Design the physical form of your AI system

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Time Management**: Each exercise is designed to take 1-2 hours. If you're spending significantly more time, consider focusing on the core concepts rather than getting bogged down in details.
- **Research**: Use academic papers, robotics journals, and reputable online resources for your research exercise.
- **Practicality**: When designing systems, consider real-world constraints and feasibility.
- **Depth vs. Breadth**: It's better to explore a few concepts in depth than to superficially cover many topics.

## Challenge Extension

For advanced students: Implement a simple simulation of one of your exercises using a robotics simulator (e.g., Gazebo, PyBullet, or Webots) or create a physical prototype using simple materials to demonstrate the concepts you've analyzed.

## Summary

These exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of Physical AI concepts through practical application and analysis. By working through these challenges, you'll develop a deeper appreciation for the fundamental differences between digital and physical AI systems and the implications of embodiment for intelligent behavior.
