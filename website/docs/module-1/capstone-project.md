# Module 1 Capstone Project: Physical AI System Integration

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will demonstrate:
- Synthesis of all Module 1 concepts into a cohesive Physical AI system
- Implementation of embodied cognition principles in a practical application
- Effective environmental interaction capabilities with uncertainty management
- Integration of ROS2 concepts for system communication and control
- Problem-solving skills in complex Physical AI scenarios

## Project Overview

The Module 1 Capstone Project challenges you to design and implement a comprehensive Physical AI system that demonstrates the integration of all concepts covered in this module. You will create a system that incorporates foundational Physical AI principles, ROS2 communication patterns, embodied cognition, and environmental interaction capabilities.

Your system should demonstrate how intelligence emerges from the interaction between an embodied agent and its environment, leveraging the principles of morphological computation, affordance utilization, and adaptive behavior.

## Project Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Embodied Design**: Your system must demonstrate principles of embodied cognition where the physical form contributes to intelligent behavior
2. **Environmental Interaction**: The system must actively interact with and adapt to its environment
3. **ROS2 Integration**: All system components must communicate using ROS2 patterns and protocols
4. **Uncertainty Management**: The system must handle environmental uncertainty and sensor noise
5. **Adaptive Behavior**: The system must adapt its behavior based on environmental conditions
6. **Safety Considerations**: The system must incorporate appropriate safety measures

### Technical Specifications

- Use ROS2 Humble Hawksbill (or newer LTS version)
- Implement at least 3 different node types with appropriate communication patterns
- Use appropriate Quality of Service settings for different data types
- Include custom message types for specific application needs
- Implement both reactive and predictive behaviors
- Demonstrate morphological computation where appropriate
- Include uncertainty representation and management

## Project Options

Choose one of the following project themes, or propose your own with instructor approval:

### Option 1: Autonomous Navigation Robot
Design a robot that navigates through a complex environment using embodied cognition principles:
- Demonstrate affordance-based navigation (following walls, using landmarks)
- Implement reactive obstacle avoidance using sensorimotor coupling
- Show adaptation to environmental changes
- Include uncertainty management for sensor data

### Option 2: Adaptive Manipulation System
Create a manipulation system that adapts its approach based on object and environment properties:
- Demonstrate morphological computation in grasping strategies
- Show affordance recognition for different objects
- Implement adaptive control based on environmental feedback
- Include uncertainty management for tactile and visual sensing

### Option 3: Environmental Monitoring Agent
Develop an agent that monitors and interacts with its environment:
- Demonstrate context-aware behavior
- Show adaptation to changing environmental conditions
