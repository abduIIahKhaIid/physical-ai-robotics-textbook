# Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Robotics

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, exploring how artificial intelligence differs when it operates in physical systems rather than purely digital environments. We'll examine the principles of embodied intelligence and how agents learn through interaction with the physical world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI approaches
- Explain the concept of embodied cognition and its importance in robotics
- Analyze the role of sensorimotor learning in intelligent systems
- Compare different approaches to implementing Physical AI

## Topics Covered

### Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
- What is Physical AI?
- Differences between digital and physical AI systems
- Historical context and evolution
- Current applications and future potential

### Week 2: Sensorimotor Learning and Perception
- Sensory input processing
- Motor control and feedback loops
- Learning through interaction
- Adaptive behavior mechanisms

### Week 3: Embodied Cognition and Environmental Interaction
- The role of embodiment in cognition
- Environmental affordances
- Situated action and context-awareness
- Emergent behaviors in physical systems
