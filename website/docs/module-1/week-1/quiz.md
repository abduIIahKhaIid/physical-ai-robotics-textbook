10. B) Physical AI systems must operate in unpredictable physical environments where errors can have immediate consequences

### Sample Short Answer Responses:

**Question 11:**
Digital AI systems typically interact with symbolic or digital data in controlled environments. They can process data in batches, pause computation, and operate without physical constraints. In contrast, physical AI systems must continuously interact with their environment in real-time, respect physical laws and constraints (like mass, energy, and momentum), and handle uncertainty and noise inherent in physical sensing and actuation. While digital AI systems can reproduce results perfectly, physical AI systems must handle variability and uncertainty as a natural part of their operation.

**Question 12:**
Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment. The physical form of an agent is not just a vessel for computation but an integral part of the cognitive process. Embodiment is important because it shapes how the agent perceives, acts, and learns. For example, the shape of a bird's wing naturally generates lift without requiring complex computational algorithms - the physical form embodies the solution to the flight problem. This is morphological computation where the physical structure contributes to the intelligent behavior.

## Summary

This quiz assessed your understanding of the fundamental concepts of Physical AI, including the differences between digital and physical AI systems, the principles of embodied intelligence, and the implications of physical constraints on AI system design.

## Next Steps

Achieve a score of 80% or higher before proceeding to [Week 2: ROS2 Introduction](../week-2/). If you scored below 80%, review the Week 1 materials before retaking the quiz.
