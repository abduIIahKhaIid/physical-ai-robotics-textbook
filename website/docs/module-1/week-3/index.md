# Module 1, Week 3: Embodied Cognition and Environmental Interaction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Explain the role of embodiment in cognition
- Analyze environmental affordances
- Describe situated action and context-awareness
- Evaluate emergent behaviors in physical systems

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: The Role of Embodiment in Cognition
- Embodied cognition theory
- Body-mind interaction
- Cognitive processes and physical form
- Influence of morphology on behavior

### Day 2: Environmental Affordances
- Gibson's theory of affordances
- Perceiving environmental possibilities
- Action possibilities in physical space
- Recognition of environmental features

### Day 3: Situated Action and Context-Awareness
- Context-dependent behavior
- Environmental state representation
- Real-time adaptation to surroundings
- Situated reasoning approaches

### Day 4: Emergent Behaviors in Physical Systems
- Self-organizing behaviors
- Complex behaviors from simple rules
- Interaction-driven emergence
- Stability and adaptability balance

### Day 5: Module 1 Review and Assessment
- Comprehensive review of Module 1 concepts
- Quiz preparation and practice
- Practical exercise synthesis
- Transition to Module 2
