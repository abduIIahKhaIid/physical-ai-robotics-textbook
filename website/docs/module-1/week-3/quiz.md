10. B) Using conservative, risk-averse decision making

### Sample Short Answer Responses:

**Question 11:**
Traditional symbolic AI approaches involve creating internal models of the environment and planning actions based on these models. The robot senses the environment, constructs an abstract representation, reasons about it symbolically, and then executes planned actions. This approach requires significant computational resources and can be brittle in dynamic environments.

Embodied cognition approaches emphasize direct interaction between the robot and environment with minimal internal representation. Behaviors emerge from sensorimotor coupling, where sensory inputs directly influence motor outputs. This approach is more robust to environmental changes, requires less computational overhead, and can respond more quickly to environmental stimuli. However, it may be less suitable for tasks requiring abstract reasoning or long-term planning.

**Question 12:**
A robot using embodied cognition principles could handle uncertainty by:
- Using constant environmental interaction to maintain situational awareness rather than relying on potentially outdated internal models
- Employing reactive behaviors that respond directly to environmental stimuli
- Using morphological computation where the robot's physical form provides stability and adaptability
- Implementing robust behaviors that gracefully degrade in uncertain conditions
- Exploiting environmental features for stability and reference points
- Using active sensing strategies to gather information when needed
- Employing probabilistic approaches to combine uncertain sensor readings
- Implementing conservative behaviors when uncertainty is high

## Summary

This quiz assessed your understanding of embodied cognition principles and environmental interaction in Physical AI systems. These concepts are crucial for creating robots that can effectively operate in real-world environments by leveraging their physical embodiment and environmental interaction capabilities.
