# Module 2: Advanced Robot Simulation & Gazebo Frameworks

## Overview

This module introduces you to robot simulation using Gazebo, the premier simulation environment for robotics development. You'll learn how to create realistic simulation environments, integrate robot models, configure physics and sensors, and connect your simulations to ROS2 for comprehensive testing and development.

Simulation is a critical component of robotics development, allowing you to test algorithms, validate control systems, and experiment with robot behaviors in a safe, cost-effective environment before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Import and integrate robot models into Gazebo
- Configure physics properties and sensor models for realistic simulation
- Connect ROS2 nodes to Gazebo for hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Validate robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Topics Covered

### Week 1: Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals
- Introduction to Gazebo and simulation concepts
- Setting up the simulation environment
- Basic world creation and modification
- Running your first simulation

### Week 2: Robot Model Integration
- Importing URDF/SDF robot models
- Configuring joints and transmissions
- Setting up robot state publishers
- Spawning robots in simulation

### Week 3: Physics and Sensor Simulation
- Understanding physics engines in Gazebo
- Configuring collision and visual properties
- Setting up sensor models (cameras, lidars, IMUs)
- Tuning physics parameters for realism

### Week 4: ROS2 Integration
- Connecting ROS2 nodes to Gazebo
- Using Gazebo plugins for ROS2 communication
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing concepts
- Realistic robot control in simulation
