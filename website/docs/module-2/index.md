# Module 2: Robot Kinematics and Dynamics

## Overview

This module covers the mathematical foundations for understanding and controlling robot movement. We'll explore forward and inverse kinematics, robot dynamics, and motion planning techniques that enable robots to navigate and manipulate objects in physical space.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Apply forward and inverse kinematics to robotic systems
- Model robot dynamics for motion planning
- Analyze degrees of freedom in robotic systems
- Evaluate static and dynamic stability in robotic configurations

## Topics Covered

### Week 4: Forward and Inverse Kinematics
- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Denavit-Hartenberg parameters
- Forward kinematics calculations
- Inverse kinematics solutions
- Singularity analysis

### Week 5: Robot Dynamics and Motion Planning
- Newton-Euler formulation
- Lagrangian mechanics for robots
- Trajectory planning
- Obstacle avoidance
- Path optimization

### Week 6: Degrees of Freedom and Stability Analysis
- Joint space vs. Cartesian space
- Workspace analysis
- Static stability considerations
- Dynamic stability evaluation
- Control implications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should:
- Complete [Module 1](./module-1/)
