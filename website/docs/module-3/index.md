# Module 3: Control Systems and Locomotion

## Overview

This module explores the principles of control systems and locomotion in humanoid robotics. We'll examine feedback control mechanisms, walking algorithms, balance control, and the challenges of creating stable, efficient locomotion in bipedal robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Design feedback control systems for robotic applications
