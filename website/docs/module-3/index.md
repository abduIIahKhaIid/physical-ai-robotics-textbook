# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim / Isaac ROS Lessons

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS for developing perception and navigation pipelines, with emphasis on sim-to-real transfer concepts.

## Overview

This module covers:
- Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim environment and setup
- Perception pipeline implementation using Isaac ROS
- Navigation pipeline development with path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Sim-to-real transfer concepts and domain randomization techniques
- Practical lab exercises integrating all concepts

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement perception pipelines using Isaac ROS for camera and LiDAR processing
- Develop navigation systems with path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques to bridge the reality gap
- Combine perception and navigation in integrated robotics applications

## Module Structure

This module is organized into 5 weeks of content:

- **Week 1**: [Introduction to Isaac Sim Environment](./week-1/introduction-to-isaac-sim.md)
  - [Isaac Sim Setup](./week-1/isaac-sim-setup.md)
  - [Lab 1: Isaac Sim Basics](./week-1/lab-1-isaac-sim-basics.md)

- **Week 2**: [Perception Pipelines Overview](./week-2/perception-pipelines-overview.md)
  - [Camera and LiDAR Processing](./week-2/camera-lidar-processing.md)
  - [Lab 2: Perception Pipeline Implementation](./week-2/lab-2-perception-pipeline.md)

- **Week 3**: [Navigation Pipeline Basics](./week-3/navigation-pipeline-basics.md)
  - [Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance](./week-3/path-planning-obstacle-avoidance.md)
  - [Lab 3: Navigation Implementation](./week-3/lab-3-navigation-implementation.md)

- **Week 4**: [Sim-to-Real Concepts](./week-4/sim-to-real-concepts.md)
  - [Domain Randomization Techniques](./week-4/domain-randomization.md)
  - [Lab 4: Sim-to-Real Transfer](./week-4/lab-4-sim-to-real-transfer.md)

- **Week 5**: [Integrated Project](./week-5/integrated-project.md)
  - [Module 3 Assessment](./week-5/module-3-assessment.md)
  - [Troubleshooting Guide](./week-5/troubleshooting-guide.md)

Each week includes theoretical lessons and hands-on lab exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with simulation environments (covered in Module 2)
- Basic knowledge of ROS/ROS2 concepts
- Access to compatible hardware for Isaac Sim (see [Hardware Requirements](../hardware-requirements.md))

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Introduction to Isaac Sim Environment](./week-1/introduction-to-isaac-sim.md) lesson to familiarize yourself with the simulation platform before diving into perception and navigation pipelines.
