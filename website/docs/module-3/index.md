# Module 3: Advanced Isaac Sim & Perception Systems

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook! This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS for developing perception and navigation pipelines, with emphasis on sim-to-real transfer concepts.

## Overview

This module covers:
- Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim environment and setup
- Perception pipeline implementation using Isaac ROS
- Navigation pipeline development with path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Sim-to-real transfer concepts and domain randomization techniques
- Practical lab exercises integrating all concepts

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement perception pipelines using Isaac ROS for camera and LiDAR processing
- Develop navigation systems with path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Apply sim-to-real transfer techniques to bridge the reality gap
- Combine perception and navigation in integrated robotics applications

Each week includes theoretical lessons and hands-on lab exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with simulation environments (covered in Module 2)
- Basic knowledge of ROS/ROS2 concepts
- Access to compatible hardware for Isaac Sim (see [Hardware Requirements](../hardware-requirements.md))

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Introduction to Isaac Sim Environment](./3.1-introduction-to-isaac-sim/isaac-sim-overview-foundations.md) lesson to familiarize yourself with the simulation platform before diving into perception and navigation pipelines.
