# Humanoid Fundamentals

This section covers the mathematical and kinematic foundations that underpin humanoid robotics. Understanding these concepts is crucial for controlling humanoid robot movements and behaviors.

## Topics Covered

- Forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid structures
- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Joint configurations and degrees of freedom
- Kinematic chains and their properties

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:
- Calculate forward kinematics for humanoid robot arms and legs
- Solve inverse kinematics problems for reaching and stepping motions
- Apply coordinate transformation principles to robot movement
- Understand the relationship between joint angles and end-effector positions

## Content Structure

- [Forward Kinematics](./forward-kinematics.md) - Understanding how joint angles determine position
- [Inverse Kinematics](./inverse-kinematics.md) - Determining joint angles for desired positions
- [Coordinate Systems](./coordinate-systems.md) - Essential reference frames for robot movement
- [Kinematics Lab](./kinematics-lab.md) - Hands-on exercises to practice kinematic calculations

These fundamentals form the basis for all humanoid robot movement and control systems.
