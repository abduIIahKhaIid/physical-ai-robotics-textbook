# Locomotion and Manipulation

This section explores the critical aspects of humanoid robot mobility and interaction. You'll learn how humanoid robots achieve stable walking and perform complex manipulation tasks with dexterity.

## Topics Covered

- Bipedal walking mechanics and balance control
- Gait patterns and walking dynamics
- Grasping principles and manipulation strategies
- Dexterous manipulation techniques

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:
- Explain the principles of stable bipedal locomotion
- Describe different gait patterns and their applications
- Design effective grasping strategies for various objects
- Implement dexterous manipulation techniques for humanoid robots

## Content Structure

- [Bipedal Walking](./bipedal-walking.md) - Mechanics of human-like walking
- [Gait Patterns](./gait-patterns.md) - Different walking styles and their characteristics
- [Grasping Principles](./grasping-principles.md) - Techniques for effective object interaction
- [Dexterous Manipulation](./dexterous-manipulation.md) - Advanced manipulation skills
- [Locomotion and Manipulation Lab](./locomotion-manipulation-lab.md) - Practical exercises for movement and interaction

These capabilities distinguish humanoid robots from other robot forms and enable them to interact with human-designed environments.
