# Conversational Robotics

This section explores how humanoid robots engage in natural interaction with humans through conversation and communication. Effective human-robot communication is essential for collaborative robotics applications.

## Topics Covered

- Dialogue systems and intent mapping
- Social interaction principles
- Human-robot communication design
- Safety and ethical considerations in interaction

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:
- Design dialogue systems that map human intents to robot actions
- Implement appropriate social interaction behaviors
- Create effective human-robot communication interfaces
- Apply safety and ethical guidelines to conversational systems

## Content Structure

- [Dialogue Systems](./dialogue-systems.md) - Understanding intent-to-action mapping
- [Social Interaction](./social-interaction.md) - Principles of appropriate robot behavior
- [Human-Robot Communication](./human-robot-communication.md) - Designing effective interfaces
- [Conversational Robotics Lab](./conversational-robotics-lab.md) - Practical exercises in communication

Conversational robotics bridges the gap between human intentions and robot actions, making robots more accessible and useful in daily life.
