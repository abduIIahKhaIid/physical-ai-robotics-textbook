# Safety Considerations

This section addresses critical safety aspects that must be considered in humanoid robot design, deployment, and operation. As humanoid robots operate in close proximity to humans, safety considerations are paramount to prevent harm and ensure ethical behavior.

## Topics Covered

- Physical safety in robot design and operation
- Ethical considerations in humanoid robotics
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Safety standards and compliance

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:
- Identify potential safety hazards in humanoid robot operation
- Implement physical safety measures in robot design
- Address ethical considerations in human-robot interaction
- Apply risk assessment methodologies to robotic systems

## Content Structure

- [Physical Safety](./physical-safety.md) - Engineering safeguards and protection mechanisms
- [Ethical Considerations](./ethical-considerations.md) - Moral and societal implications of humanoid robots

Safety considerations must be integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle of humanoid robots, from initial design through deployment and operation.
