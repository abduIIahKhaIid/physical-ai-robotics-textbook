# Module 4 Capstone Project

This capstone project brings together all the concepts learned throughout Module 4. You will design and implement a comprehensive humanoid robot application that integrates kinematics, locomotion, manipulation, VLA models, and conversational capabilities.

## Project Overview

Your challenge is to create a humanoid robot system that demonstrates competency in all five major areas covered in this module:

1. **Kinematics** - Accurate movement and positioning
2. **Locomotion** - Stable walking and navigation
3. **Manipulation** - Grasping and object interaction
4. **VLA Integration** - Vision-language-action coordination
5. **Conversational Capability** - Natural human-robot interaction

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will demonstrate:
- Integration of multiple robotic subsystems
- Application of kinematic principles to solve movement problems
- Implementation of stable locomotion and manipulation
- Use of VLA models for intelligent behavior
- Creation of effective conversational interfaces

## Project Phases

1. [Project Overview](./project-overview.md) - Understanding the full scope and requirements
2. [Implementation Guidelines](./implementation-guidelines.md) - Step-by-step approach to development
3. [Evaluation Criteria](./evaluation-criteria.md) - Standards for assessing your work

Complete the project by following the phased approach, ensuring each component meets the specified requirements before integration.
