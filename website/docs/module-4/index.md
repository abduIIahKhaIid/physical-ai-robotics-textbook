# Module 4: Advanced AI for Humanoid Systems

## Overview

This capstone module integrates advanced AI techniques with humanoid robotics. We'll explore machine learning for humanoid control, perception systems, multimodal integration, and the evaluation of humanoid behavior in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Implement machine learning algorithms for humanoid control
- Design perception systems for humanoid robots
- Integrate multimodal sensing and actuation systems
- Evaluate humanoid behavior in real-world scenarios
- Synthesize knowledge from all previous modules

## Topics Covered

### 4.1 Humanoid Fundamentals
- Forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid systems
- Coordinate systems and transformations
- Kinematic chains and workspace analysis
- Mathematical foundations for movement
- Implementation of kinematic algorithms

### 4.2 Locomotion and Manipulation
- Bipedal walking mechanics and balance control
- Gait patterns and walking dynamics
- Grasping principles and manipulation strategies
- Dexterous manipulation techniques
- Integration of locomotion and manipulation

### 4.3 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Concepts
- VLA model architectures and implementation
- Embodied AI integration principles
- Practical applications of VLA in robotics
- Multi-modal learning approaches
- Deep learning for integrated perception-action

### 4.4 Conversational Robotics
- Dialogue systems and intent mapping
- Social interaction principles
- Human-robot communication design
- Personality integration and natural interaction
- Conversational robotics laboratory exercises

### 4.5 Safety Considerations
- Physical safety in robot design and operation
- Ethical considerations in humanoid robotics
