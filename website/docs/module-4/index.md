# Module 4: Advanced AI for Humanoid Systems

## Overview

This capstone module integrates advanced AI techniques with humanoid robotics. We'll explore machine learning for humanoid control, perception systems, multimodal integration, and the evaluation of humanoid behavior in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Implement machine learning algorithms for humanoid control
- Design perception systems for humanoid robots
- Integrate multimodal sensing and actuation systems
- Evaluate humanoid behavior in real-world scenarios
- Synthesize knowledge from all previous modules

## Topics Covered

### Week 11: Machine Learning for Humanoid Control
- Reinforcement learning for motor control
- Deep learning for motion generation
- Imitation learning from demonstrations
- Learning from human feedback
- Transfer learning between robot platforms

### Week 12: Perception Systems and Multimodal Integration
- Computer vision for humanoid robots
- Audio processing and speech recognition
- Tactile sensing and haptic feedback
- Sensor fusion techniques
- Attention mechanisms for perception

### Week 13: Real-World Applications and Evaluation
- Human-robot interaction scenarios
- Performance metrics and evaluation methods
- Ethical considerations in humanoid AI
- Future directions and emerging technologies
- Capstone project presentations
